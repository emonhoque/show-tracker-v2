## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase account

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emonhoque/show-tracker
   cd show-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   - Create a new project in Supabase
   - Go to SQL Editor and run the contents of `database-complete-setup.sql`
   - This single file sets up tables, indexes, and optimized RLS policies

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Public environment variables (available to client)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PASSWORD="your-chosen-password"
   
   # Server-only environment variables
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   
   # Timezone configuration
   TZ=America/New_York
   
   # Vercel Storage Blob (optional)
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=blob
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Visit** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

### Web App
1. Enter the shared password and your name
2. Add shows with the "Add" button
3. RSVP to upcoming shows
4. Past shows are automatically moved to the Past tab

### PWA Installation
- **Mobile**: Tap "Add to Home Screen" in your browser menu
- **Desktop**: Look for the install button in your browser's address bar
- **Features**: Once installed, scroll-to-top functionality, and native app-like experience

### Time Picker
- Shows start at 3:00 PM and cycle through to 2:00 PM the next day
- Covers realistic show times from afternoon to late night
- No more scrolling through 3 AM times for evening shows!

### Filtering System
The app includes a powerful filtering system to help you find specific shows:

#### Status Filters
- **All**: Shows all upcoming shows (default)
- **Going**: Shows where people have RSVP'd as "Going"
- **Maybe**: Shows where people have RSVP'd as "Maybe"
- **Not Going**: Shows where people have RSVP'd as "Not Going"

#### People Filters
- **Everyone**: Shows all upcoming shows (default)
- **Individual People**: Filter by specific attendees
- **Smart Logic**: When multiple people are selected, shows only events where ALL selected people have the selected status

#### Filter Examples
- Select "John" + "Taylor" + "Going" = Shows where both John AND Taylor are going
- Select "Going" only = Shows where anyone is going
- Select "Sarah" + "Maybe" = Shows where Sarah is maybe attending

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new):

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add your environment variables in Vercel's dashboard
4. Deploy!

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2, React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with performance optimizations
- **PWA**: Service Worker, Web App Manifest
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Date Handling**: date-fns with timezone support
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob for poster uploads
- **Performance**: Vercel Speed Insights
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## Database Setup

The app uses a single, comprehensive database setup file (`database-complete-setup.sql`) that includes:

- **Tables**: `shows` and `rsvps` with proper relationships
- **Show Fields**: title, date_time, time_local, city, venue, ticket_url, spotify_url, apple_music_url, google_photos_url, poster_url, notes
- **Indexes**: Optimized for upcoming/past shows and RSVP joins
- **RLS Policies**: Streamlined for performance and security
- **Statistics**: Updated for optimal query planning

### Key Database Optimizations

1. **Combined Queries**: Shows and RSVPs are fetched together, eliminating the N+1 query problem
2. **Strategic Indexes**: 
   - `idx_shows_upcoming` for upcoming shows queries
   - `idx_shows_past` for past shows queries  
   - `idx_rsvps_show_status` for efficient RSVP joins
3. **RLS Optimization**: Single policy per action, no duplicate evaluations
4. **Response Caching**: API responses cached for 1-5 minutes depending on data type
