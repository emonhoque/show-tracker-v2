## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase account
- A Spotify Developer account (for Release Radar feature)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emonhoque/show-tracker
   cd show-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   - Create a new project in Supabase
   - Go to SQL Editor and run the database migration scripts
   - This will set up tables, indexes, and optimized RLS policies

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Public environment variables (available to client)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PASSWORD="your-chosen-password"
   
   # Server-only environment variables
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   
   # Timezone configuration
   TZ=America/New_York
   
   # Vercel Storage Blob (optional)
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=blob
   
   # Spotify API (for Release Radar feature)
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   
   # Cron job security (optional)
   CRON_SECRET=your_secure_random_string
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Visit** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

### Web App
1. Enter the shared password and your name
2. Add shows with the "Add" button
3. RSVP to upcoming shows
4. Export shows to your calendar using the "Add to Calendar" button
5. Past shows are automatically moved to the Past tab
6. Check the "Music" tab to see new music from tracked artists

### PWA Installation
- **Mobile**: Tap "Add to Home Screen" in your browser menu
- **Desktop**: Look for the install button in your browser's address bar
- **Features**: Once installed, scroll-to-top functionality, and native app-like experience

### Time Picker
- Shows start at 3:00 PM and cycle through to 2:00 PM the next day
- Covers realistic show times from afternoon to late night
- No more scrolling through 3 AM times for evening shows!

### Calendar Export
- Export shows to Google Calendar with one click
- Download ICS files for Apple Calendar, Outlook, and other calendar apps
- Automatic timezone conversion for accurate show times
- Includes all show details: title, venue, time, notes, and links

### Filtering System
The app includes a powerful filtering system to help you find specific shows:

#### Status Filters
- **All**: Shows all upcoming shows (default)
- **Going**: Shows where people have RSVP'd as "Going"
- **Maybe**: Shows where people have RSVP'd as "Maybe"
- **Not Going**: Shows where people have RSVP'd as "Not Going"

#### People Filters
- **Everyone**: Shows all upcoming shows (default)
- **Individual People**: Filter by specific attendees
- **Smart Logic**: When multiple people are selected, shows only events where ALL selected people have the selected status

#### Filter Examples
- Select "John" + "Taylor" + "Going" = Shows where both John AND Taylor are going
- Select "Going" only = Shows where anyone is going
- Select "Sarah" + "Maybe" = Shows where Sarah is maybe attending

### Release Radar Feature
The app now includes a community-driven Release Radar tracking system:

#### Adding Artists
1. Go to the "Music" tab
2. Click "Add Artist" to search for artists via Spotify
3. Once added, the artist's releases will be visible to all users
4. Artists are shared across the entire community

#### Viewing Releases
- New releases from all tracked artists appear in the Music tab
- Shows releases from the last 12 weeks by default
- Each release shows artist name, release type (album/single/EP), release date, and Spotify link
- Releases are automatically fetched and updated

#### Automatic Updates
- Set up a cron job to call `/api/cron/check-releases` periodically
- This checks all tracked artists for new releases
- New releases are automatically added to the database

## Database Setup

The app uses comprehensive database migration scripts that include:

- **Tables**: `shows`, `rsvps`, `artists`, `releases`, and `user_artists` with proper relationships

### Key Database Optimizations

1. **Combined Queries**: Shows and RSVPs are fetched together, eliminating the N+1 query problem
2. **Strategic Indexes**: 
   - `idx_shows_upcoming` for upcoming shows queries
   - `idx_shows_past` for past shows queries  
   - `idx_rsvps_show_status` for efficient RSVP joins
3. **RLS Optimization**: Single policy per action, no duplicate evaluations
